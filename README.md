# 3D_Maxwell-Yee
An experimental Matlab package to solve full 3D Maxwell equations. The solver uses modified Yee algorithm, with Crank-Nicolson scheme. 

## Usage:
Look at the *Demo code.m* file for examples and usage.
 
## Example files:
Video files for an example problem with homogeneous Dirichlet conditions and an alternating line charge distribution oriented along the z-axis at the center of a cube, are stored in the *Examples* folder. These files were generated with the *Demo code.m* script.
